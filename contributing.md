# Partcipating in Open-App Ecosystem

## Overview

Eventually you will be able to particpate by starting your own node! For the time being we're still developing the ecosystem's building blocks.

Developers can participate in three ways:

 * develop a service
 * make your app *interoperable* with the ecosystem by adopting common vocabularies and data formats
 * *integrate* with Open-App API's 

## Developmet Philosophy

Open-App takes a lot of inspiration from the following talks:
 * [Many Things](http://substack.net/many_things) - by [substack](https://github.com/substack)
 * [The Unix Philosophy and Node.js](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-node-js)

## Create a 'Service'

services do one thing. 

 * People - stores data on persons.
 * Groups - stores group data.
 * Identity - authenticates users



## Make your API Interoperable with the Ecosystem:


## Integrate with the Open-App API








vocab ontologies: OWL
type schemas: JSON-Schema v4
services:
content:
JSON-LD
JSON services can have translation layer to become JSON-LD services
Triple Pattern Fragments
interfaces:
HTTP
WebSockets
libchan
serialization formats:
JSON
msgpack v5
Transit?
hypermedia formats:
JSON-API?
Hydra?



user interfaces: Web Components
while Web Components is still unsupported in browsers (and suffers from bad performance), we may temporarily standardize on something like React or mercury, which can then be Web Component-ified later.
