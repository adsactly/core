every agent should have complete control of their data and how it is shared. they have to trust their host (either them or a group they are a member of) who actually stores the data to enforce their control.

i've been thinking about nodes as agents, which includes people or groups (or projects which i think are short-term groups). then, as not every agent wants to host themselves in the network, group agents can host their members. we can achieve federated querying amongst network-of-networks with http://linkeddatafragments.org/.
