# Open App Ecosystem

The Open App Ecosystem is a suite of of integrated and open sourced apps which support *commons-based peer production*.

The aim is for the software to act as a delivery mechanism for cultural viruses which decentralise money, information and control and promote happiness, empowerment and wellbeing throughout an organisation. They also have the side effect of helping organisations become more efficient, resilient and adaptable.

## Overview

 1. [Roadmap](/roadmap.md) - How does the ecosystem work and how will we get there?

## The Apps

This Document will be updated with further info to help those interested understand the vision and technical details of the ecosytem. [This Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Ovx5Pkn7/open-app-overview) has an initial overview of the microservices and apps we are working on. Check the [top-level org repo](https://github.com/open-app) for the current state of play.
